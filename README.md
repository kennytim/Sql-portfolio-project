# Covid dataset expolaration using SQL.

 The dataset was analysed using sql through queries written to extract meaningful information from the dataset
 I have two tables covid_death and covid_vac respectively.
 Each table contains a couple of columns
 I performed several joins , used a lot of aggregate functions to extract the information.
